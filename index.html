    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My Name is <em>Samantha Brown</em>, I am 35 years old. I have two son's. I used have a career in marketing. I have worked for a number of companies ranging from small family run companies to large FMCG. </br> I worked in Marketing for 13 years.However it was time for a change.This opportunity as come up for me to become a full stack developer. I want to thank <strong>Blackcodher</strong> for this opportunity.</p>
    <p>I am applying for a position on the CodHER course as I feel it is the next necessary steps for me to take, to move back into a fast-paced working environment. My primary reason for making this application is that, I am looking for a change of career and I believe this would help me to take those necessary steps. I have worked in a marketing environment for the last 13 years, I have been made redundant three times and I am only 35 years old.</p>
    <p>I would describe myself as a professional individual, who is very passionate and eager to learn new skills. My interest in technology started whilst I employed at an IT training company as a Marketing Officer. I worked closely with the trainers and web developers to create a strategy to market various IT courses from the CompTia A+N+ to various Microsoft programs, such as MCSE, MCP, Linux etc.</p>
    <p>The Marketing department is always the first department to be downsized when any company hits financial difficulty. For this purpose I feel that I need to move into an industry where I may be valued more. After the COVID-19 pandemic I am not sure if I will have a job to return to, as the company I am currently employed by, was looking at making redundancies prior to the current global situation.</p>
    <p>We live in a technological era, I believe there is so much growth and opportunities within the IT industry. Completing such a course will open the doors for so many opportunities and put me in a better position to support my family. </p>
    <p>Having the disposable funds available to retrain in a new field is not something that I can currently afford, when I saw this opportunity I believe that it has come to me, at the right time in my life. </p>
    <p>I have worked for large and small organisations, I have never seen a black woman working in the IT department, or working for any of the agencies I have worked with. We are living in a time where women should also have the same opportunities in the I.T. industry, especially Black Women. It is time for change and I would like to be a part of that change. </p>

    <p>My mentor is <strong>Jess</strong> I am looking forward to my mentorship with Jess. I am sure I can learn so much from her. </p>
